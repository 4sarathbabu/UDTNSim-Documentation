Mobility Models in UDTNSim
==========================

The mobility models followed by nodes form an influential factor in
determining the performance of any DTN. This section describe different
mobility models that are integrated in UDTNSim and the ways to edit them to
develop new mobility models. 

The existing mobility models include:

1. Stationary mobility model
2. Random mobility model
3. Path based mobility model
